## **Reflective Analysis**

In this lab, I wanted to produce a thematic map that might be somewhat more fun and less gloomy compared to my first lab. It was designed with coffee lovers in mind, especially for the Starbucks fanatics that with a click of a button, be able to see where the nearest Starbucks location was. If one wanted to increase or decrease radius in meters, they could do that, and if one wanted to see how many Starbucks locations were within this radius, they will be able to see the exact number. The various interactivity included adds a level of entertainment and engagement. Compared to my previous lab where “raising awareness” can be slightly subjective, this time, the goal is more concrete – “which Starbucks locations and how many fall within my selected radius”. As this was a thematic map focusing one singular objective, I wanted to keep the base-map muted while still showing major streets for directions. I wanted to keep the theme of coffee and Starbucks, thus green, brown, white, and red for highlighting was selected. Everything was brighter in colour as well, much like the legend, as users looking for Starbucks nearby would mostly use this map during the day (no night-mode style dark colours). The Starbucks location names were bolded to highlight them, and notable neighbourhoods like Kerrisdale or Shaughnessy had larger font size and red labels so that the users can grasp their cursor location relative to these neighbourhoods while they were clicking around the map. The radius colour was selected as brown to keep the theme of coffee and Starbucks locations would light up red when within the radius to visually pop. Originally, I had the Starbucks locations ranging all around Metro-Vancouver, but I wanted to keep this local and in Vancouver only. Without interactivity powered by the web mapping, this map would not be possible. The toggles of Starbucks icons, radius slider to increase or decrease the overall radius, box to see the size of the selected radius, and number of Starbucks inside the radius all combine to give more understanding around the clicked location relative to nearby Starbucks locations. It adds a level of amusement and entertainment, seeing nearby locations light up in red as well. Originally, I had wished for the custom Starbucks icons to be within the html code, however, I could not find a solution, so I had to load in the Mapbox Studio created map with the icons already in place to avoid this obstacle. The coordinates are there with the points, but the icon is not part of the points in the coding. So, I had to slightly fool the audience into thinking these icons were light up, but in reality, there is a manual point in the same location. I also wished for the icons to grow when selected, however, due to the previous mentioned factor, I could not find a way for this. Zoom levels in Mapbox Studio were very finicky and wonky, thus some Starbucks are not visible in certain zoom scale. Another way that the map could greatly benefit is that wherever the user clicked, a line would form to direct them to THE closest Starbucks. I am certain there is a work around to this in Turf library, but to specify which Starbucks the line would point to when there are myriad of locations within the radius, would be challenging. Also, the import of csv file of Starbucks lat/long to the Mapbox Studio was seamless, however, adding manual points to the coding that are in the same location was quite tedious. I have heard of Google Maps APIs that can be directly loaded, but I am not familiar with the methods. Overall, although might be slightly simplistic in nature, it does accomplish what it set out to do, but also many ways that it can be improved in the future. 

## Critiques & Reliance on Sources

The core idea and part of the codes were influenced and taken from the Mapbox tutorial - https://labs.mapbox.com/education/proximity-analysis/selecting-within-a-distance/. It helped me learn how to use Mapbox and Turf in conjunction, while displaying the capabilities of buffers and proximity analysis. There were few changes in the coding to accomodate the multiple interactive elements to the map. Some critiques from my friends for the original version of the map was that it lacked interactivity. Because the map was simple in nature, without the various interactivity, it would fall flat and much less engaging compared to the current iteration. The custom Starbucks icon was also missing originally, but adding it increased the legitimatcy of the Starbucks branding that makes the final version of the map a real thematic map.
